# Arithmetic Series Generator

This project is a simple arithmetic series generator that takes an input number `N` and generates an arithmetic sequence of `N` numbers, starting from `2` with a difference of `3`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arithmetic-series-generator.git
   cd arithmetic-series-generator
   ```

2. Make sure you have Python installed. You can check if Python is installed by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   For N = 4, the output will be:

   ```bash
   2, 5, 8, 11
   ```

   For N = 7, the output will be:

   ```bash
   2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20
   ```
